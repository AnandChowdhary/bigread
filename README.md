# 🐦 Mockingbird

Mockingbird is an app to help people with visual impairment read text on objects more easily using their smartphone's camera. It was built for multiple sclerosis patients by Creative Technology BSc students at the University of Twente.

Using Mockingbird, you can click a photo and see it on your computer's big screen in real-time. You can also set up zooming, focusing, and more to exactly see what you want to. It works on devices running Android, iOS, or iPadOS.
